# BASSMIDI-Driver
A Windows user-mode software MIDI synthesizer driver based on Ian Luck's BASSMIDI library

This project has been superseded many times over by at least two forks, one of which I will
openly link to, because I am friends with the developer, and he continues to share his
source code with the public and assumedly accepts contributions.
